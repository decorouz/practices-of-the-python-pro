Summary
1. Design for performance both up front and iteratively throughout your development.


2. Think carefully about the right data type for the task.

3. Prefer generators over lists when you donâ€™t need all the values at once, to save on memory usage.

4. Use the timeit and cProfile/profile Python modules to test your hypotheses about complexity and performance.
