The anatomy of a functional test:
1.  Set up the inputs
2.  Identify the required/expected output
2.  Obtain the actual output
4.  Compare the expeced and actual outputs


If you want to test the transform_name_for_sku method from the Product class, this recipe becomes:

1.  Create an instance of Product with a name, size, and color.
2.  Observe that transform_name_for_sku return name.upper(); the expected result is the name in uppercase.
3.  Call the Product instance's transform_name_for_sku method and save it in a variable
4. Compare the expected result to the saved actual result
